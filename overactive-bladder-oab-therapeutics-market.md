<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Overactive Bladder (OAB) Therapeutics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anticholinergic Agents</li><li>Beta-3 Adrenoreceptor Agonists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Overactive Bladder (OAB) therapeutics market comprises primarily two types of medications: anticholinergic agents and beta-3 adrenoreceptor agonists. Anticholinergic agents work by blocking neurotransmitters that stimulate bladder contractions, thereby reducing urgency and frequency of urination. Beta-3 adrenoreceptor agonists, on the other hand, activate specific receptors in the bladder to relax smooth muscle and improve storage capacity. Both types aim to alleviate symptoms of OAB, providing patients with options based on their specific needs and tolerability profiles.</p></p>
